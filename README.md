## The real user

A first-time homeowner in one Orange County city who wants to add a backyard home (ADU) or a junior ADU (scenario C01 in `lanes/2-clear-it/scenarios.json`). Every city has its own forms, portal and fees. City documents sometimes cite state law that has been renumbered, and most homeowners don't know the deadlines the city must meet.

**Before:** they dig through a city website, PDFs and a 55-page state handbook, and often call the counter several times.
**After:** they pick their city and project, then get an ordered path, a printable paperwork checklist, the state rules that apply (with section numbers), flags where the city's materials look stale or out of step with state law, and a timeline built from the state's legal deadlines and real permit data.

## What we built

A web app (no build step). The **homeowner guide** (`/`) is written for someone with no legal or planning background:

- A first-run pop-up asks about the project (city, type, size, house on the lot, coastal zone); a summary bar with **Edit project**, a tap-to-call planning number (or "Find contact info ↗") and the city's ADU page stays on top.
- A collapsible sidebar shows **7 steps**: Before you apply, Gather paperwork, Submit, City review, Corrections or denial, Fees, Build and move in, with a plain duration when one is known (e.g. "Up to about 3 months", "Typically about 10 months") and a Done checkbox.
- Each step page: big **number tiles** where a number is the point (15 business days / 60 days; $0 or "Maybe" fees; typical months to move in), **What to do** in at most 3 plain bullets with action buttons, **Your rights for this step** as collapsed rows (plain headline; original wording and citation inside), and Back/Next.
- Step 1 links to the screening map; Step 2 has the printable **paperwork checklist** with one plain line per item ("what it is, who prepares it") and "Not yet confirmed" tags.
- Every citation, dataset and city source for a step sits behind its **Sources** button, with checked dates and "Not yet confirmed" where it applies. Terms like ADU, JADU, setbacks or deemed complete have a small **ⓘ** with a 1–2 sentence plain definition.
- **For cities & builders** menu: Screening map, Fast-path timeline (deadline calendar), and the **Old-law checker** (paste text to flag renumbered ADU sections; also lists each city's City-vs-state comparisons).

Cities covered: Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Orange, Santa Ana, Tustin.

### Parcel screening map (`/map.html`)

2,622 real lots in a demo area (Anaheim Hills and adjacent unincorporated land along the Santa Ana River). Each lot is tested against 6 approval paths: ADU, SB 9, SB 684 (multifamily lots), SB 1123 (vacant single-family lots), AB 2011 and SB 4.

- Every test returns **pass / fail / unknown / needs review**, and every path gets a state: **likely / possible / needs review / unknown / no**. A test whose rule or data we lack returns *unknown*; it is never guessed.
- The lot's **score** is the number of paths rated likely, possible or needs review, colored light grey (0) to dark green (6). An **orange outline** marks lots in a mapped FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area or a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.
- Click a lot to see its APN, address, zoning, score, and every test with its result, reason and citation.
- Filters: minimum acreage, a specific path, hide hazard lots, with a running "X of Y lots shown" count.
- `map.html?apn=35631101` deep-links to one lot.
- **Any Orange County ZIP:** type a ZIP and the server fetches that ZIP's lots on demand from the same layers (listed in `lanes/1-find-it/data/DATA-SOURCES.md`), clipped to the U.S. Census 2020 ZIP Code Tabulation Area (an approximation of the USPS ZIP). Orange County is checked against SCAG's Orange County layer. One ZIP at a time, paced requests, a 20,000-lot cap, cached in `data/zips/` (git-ignored). `map.html?zip=92808` deep-links. First load takes ~30–60 s; the county parcel server sometimes times out, in which case the page says to try again.
- All rules live in `data/screening-rules.json` (editable). The engine (`public/screening.js`) has no thresholds of its own.

### Calendar & deadlines (`/timeline.html`)

Answers "Is the city late on my application, and how much is that costing me?" for the project in the shared **Tell us about your project** panel.

- **Countdowns:** the city's completeness reply (15 business days, Gov. Code § 66317(a)(2)), the approve-or-deny decision (60 days, or 30 for a pre-approved detached plan), and your next paperwork goal. Missed completeness deadline = deemed complete (§ 66317(a)(2)(F)).
- **Is the city late?** Legal-deadline bar vs. days actually elapsed since your application became complete, with an overdue marker. Past 60 days without a decision, the application is deemed approved (§ 66317(a); HCD ADU Handbook p. 51, AB 3182). A **draft** "deemed approved" confirmation or status-request email to copy: nothing is ever sent. Lost rent = your monthly rent estimate (ASSUMPTION) × months overdue.
- **Calendar:** Week, Month, 2-month and 3-month views. Your paperwork goals in the city's listed order between your start and target dates (ASSUMPTION: spread evenly), city-published lead times (e.g. Anaheim sewer verification "up to four days") placed before the matching item, the city's legal deadlines (projected until you enter a submission date), and the city's historical median move-in. Download a `.ics` file to add it to any calendar app.
- Example: submitted Aug 1, today Nov 7 → deadline Sep 30, 98 days so far, 38 days overdue, ≈ $2,497 at $2,000/month. Dates are saved only in the browser.
- No existing house: no separate ADU clock (unknown), so no overdue or deemed-approved claim.

## How Claude is used

- **Built with Claude Code:** reading city pages and the HCD Handbook, extracting the rules with page cites, and writing the app.
- **Inside the tool:** the optional *Ask a question* box sends the question to Claude (`claude-opus-5-5`) along with our sourced JSON only. The prompt requires a citation on every fact, "unknown" when our data doesn't say, a note when a fact is only from a search snippet, and a not-legal-advice line. The person should still click through to the cited source.

## Try it

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm start            # http://localhost:3000
```

Needs Node 18+. The Q&A box is optional: copy `app/.env.example` to `app/.env` and set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without a key, everything else works and the Q&A box says it is off. Never commit `.env`.

To rebuild the permit stats from the CSVs: `npm run stats`.

## What is real and what is mocked

| Part | Status |
|---|---|
| State-law rules engine (filters rules by project) | Working, real sourced rules |
| City data for 9 cities | Working; depth varies by city (Irvine and Garden Grove deep; Fullerton, Huntington Beach and Tustin mostly "unknown") |
| Permit and build-time stats | Working, real data (third-party copy of APR) |
| Old-law checker | Working |
| Claude Q&A | Working when an API key is set |
| Printable packet | Working (browser print) |
| Parcel screening map | Working on real public data for one demo area (2,622 lots); other areas need `npm run fetch-parcels` with a new bounding box |
| Calendar & deadlines | Working; legal clocks from state law, goals from your dates, .ics export; business days skip weekends only (holidays not excluded, ASSUMPTION) |

## Where it gets things wrong

- Some city facts come only from search snippets because Santa Ana, Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Fullerton and Orange block automated reading. They are labelled *Search summary only — confirm*.
- Fees are mostly **unknown**. Only Irvine's planning deposit and Garden Grove's free plans are confirmed.
- Santa Ana's own pages disagree on paper vs. electronic submittal. We show both and don't pick one.
- Irvine shows very few ADU permits in the dataset, with years missing. This looks like a data gap, and we flag it.
- Flags such as Irvine's covenant are questions to ask the city, not findings that the city is wrong.
-- The ADU guide does not check zoning, setbacks or lot eligibility for a specific address; the screening map does a partial check for one demo area only.
- Screening map: SCAG zoning is a regional, preliminary dataset; city zoning maps win. The fire layer is the 2011 LRA map. Lots coded Specific Plan (7777) or Unknown (9999) are *unknown*. Year built is only a proxy for "vacant". SB 4 is *unknown* everywhere because ownership isn't in free data. "Likely" means every test we could run passed, not that the path applies.
- Timeline: the baseline is the brief's rounded typical project, not a measurement, and it includes rezoning even for project types that would not need it.
- We do not check zoning, setbacks, lot eligibility or fire zones for a specific address.

## Next steps

- Fill the other 25 OC cities in `lanes/2-clear-it/data/oc-cities.json` using the same schema (each city takes about 20 minutes with sources). A city permit tech could maintain its own entry.
- Add an AB 2234 (Gov Code 65913.3) audit: is each city's checklist and sample application actually online?
- Pull timelines directly from the official APR API instead of the third-party copy.
- Give permit counters a "send this packet to the applicant" view (draft only; the tool never sends anything).

## Data and privacy
